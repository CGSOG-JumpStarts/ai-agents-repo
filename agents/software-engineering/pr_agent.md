# PR-Agent

## Agents / Agentic Workflows Name

PR-Agent is a framework composed of an orchestrator and several specialized tools (agents) that assist in various aspects of the pull request lifecycle.

-   **PR-Agent Orchestrator (`PRAgent` class):** Receives commands/events from various entry points (CLI, GitHub Actions, Webhooks) and routes them to the appropriate specialized tool/agent.
-   **Describe Tool (PR Description Agent - `PRDescription` class):** Automatically generates a PR title, type (e.g., Bug fix, Feature), summary, a detailed code walkthrough of changes, and relevant labels.
-   **Review Tool (PR Review Agent - `PRReviewer` class):** Provides an AI-generated review of the PR, highlighting potential issues, security concerns, estimating review effort, and checking for tests and ticket compliance.
-   **Improve Tool (Code Suggestions Agent - `PRCodeSuggestions` class):** Scans PR code changes and suggests specific code improvements, often with committable diffs. Includes self-reflection capabilities.
-   **Ask Tool (Question Answering Agent - `PRQuestions` class):** Answers free-text questions about the PR code, changes, or context.
    -   **Ask Line Tool (`PR_LineQuestions` class):** Answers questions about specific lines of code within the PR.

-   **Generate Labels Tool (Custom Labels Agent - `PRGenerateLabels` class) ðŸ’Ž:** Suggests custom labels for the PR based on its content and user-defined label descriptions.
-   **Analyze Tool (PR Analysis Agent) ðŸ’Ž:** Scans PR changes, identifies modified code components (methods, functions, classes), and allows interactive generation of tests, documentation, and code suggestions for each component. Also facilitates finding similar code.
-   **Test Tool (Test Generation Agent - `PRTest` class) ðŸ’Ž:** Generates unit tests for selected code components based on PR changes.
-   **Custom Prompt Tool (`PRCustomPrompt` class) ðŸ’Ž:** Generates code suggestions based on a user-defined custom prompt, allowing for highly tailored feedback.

## Agent / Workflow Description

PR-Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to automate and enhance the pull request (PR) review and management process across various Git platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, etc.). It operates through a set of specialized tools, each acting as an agent focused on a specific task like describing PR changes, reviewing code, suggesting improvements, or answering questions.

The general workflow is as follows:
1.  **Invocation:** A PR-Agent tool is invoked either manually (e.g., by a user commenting `/review` on a PR, or via CLI) or automatically (e.g., when a new PR is opened, via GitHub Actions, or webhooks).
2.  **Orchestration:** The central `PRAgent` orchestrator receives the command or event. It parses the request and routes it to the appropriate specialized tool/agent (e.g., `PRReviewer` for a `/review` command).
3.  **Context Gathering:** The selected tool interacts with a `GitProvider` (e.g., `GithubProvider`) to fetch relevant data from the Git platform. This includes PR diffs, title, description, commit messages, existing comments, and file contents.
4.  **Core Abilities & Processing:** The tool may utilize several "Core Abilities" to process the gathered information:
    *   **PR Compression:** Compresses large PR diffs to fit within LLM token limits.
    *   **Dynamic Context:** Expands context around code changes dynamically based on code structure.
    *   **Ticket Context Fetching:** Retrieves information from linked Jira or GitHub issues.
    *   **RAG Context Enrichment (ðŸ’Ž):** Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation by searching the codebase for relevant code segments.
    *   **Static Code Analysis (ðŸ’Ž):** Parses code to understand components for tools like `/analyze`.
    *   **Metadata Injection:** Uses AI-generated summaries from one tool (e.g., `/describe`) as input for another.
5.  **AI Interaction:** The tool, using a `TokenHandler` to manage token limits, constructs a prompt (system and user messages) based on the processed PR data and tool-specific instructions. It then sends this prompt to an `AIHandler` (typically `LiteLLMAIHandler`), which communicates with a configured Large Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, or others.
6.  **Response Processing & Self-Reflection:** The LLM's response is received. Some tools, like `/improve`, may employ a self-reflection step where the LLM evaluates its own suggestions for quality and relevance.
7.  **Output Generation:** The tool formats the AI's (potentially self-reflected) response into a human-readable format, usually Markdown. This could be a PR review, a new PR description, code suggestions, answers to questions, etc.
8.  **Publication:** The `GitProvider` is used to publish the generated output back to the Git platform. This can involve posting a comment, updating the PR description, adding labels, or suggesting code changes directly.

Qodo Merge is the hosted version of PR-Agent, offering additional features, managed services, and enhanced privacy options.

The architecture shows how PR-Agent receives requests through various entry points, orchestrates them to specialized tools/agents, which then leverage core infrastructure, abilities, and external services (like LLMs and Git platform APIs) to process the request and deliver AI-powered feedback and actions back to the user via the Git platform. Qodo Merge builds upon this framework with additional enterprise-grade features and hosting.
